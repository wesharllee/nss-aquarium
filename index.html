                        <p>For all of you who have asked about cleaning fish tanks... Cleaning your aquarium is a simple and straight forward task, and should not take very long (Unless you have a particularly small tank or bowl, in which case care can be quite cumbersome and time consuming). The better care you provide for your tank, the healthier your fish will be, the nicer your tank will look and the easier your tank will be to care for in the future.</p>
                        <p>You should not need to take all the stuff (plants, decorations, etc.) out of the fish tank when you clean it. In fact, I would not recommend it. This just produces extra work for you and creates a large and unnecessary mess. Remember, every surface in the tank will grow some beneficial bacteria that are part of the biological filter. By removing and cleaning the decorations you stress (and may even kill) some of this bacteria, reducing the quality of your filtration until the filter recovers.</p>
                        <p>Similarly, you do not want to remove the fish from the tank when you do your regular 10-15% water change. This, again, is a lot more work on you, and creates an unnecessary mess. In addition, this can be highly stressful to the fish, and is likely to cause physical injuries to your fish.</p>
                        <p>When cleaning your aquarium, you should just remove part (10-15%) of the water and replace it with fresh, dechlorinated tap water (bowls and vases require larger water changes more often). While you are doing this, you should use your siphon to suck up some of the gunk that collects in the gravel and decorations. If you have an under gravel filter, it is very important to clean the gravel when you do your weekly water changes, this will prevent detritus and other decaying organic matter from blocking the passages between the pebbles and restricting water flow. Generally, you can clean 25-33% (1/4-1/3) of the gravel while siphoning out 10-15% of the water.</p>
                        <p>If you have algae growing on the surface of the tank or ornaments, you should get an algae scraper of some sort and scrub the glass before removing water. Many varieties of algae scrapers or scrubbers are available at your local pet store. For additional cleanliness, you could get algae eating catfish and/or scavengers to pick up some of this work for you, however, having catfish in the tank does NOT mean that you don't need to clean. In fact, algae eaters and catfish, like any other fish, will add to the biological load of your tank and increase maintenance requirements. (And even those catfish that will eat some algae will not eat much and are unlikely to keep the tank looking clean.)</p>
